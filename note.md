Instructions should say whether the tests for Users include adding in layout partials.
Not sure whether I am doing something wrong by manually adding in various view
files to get the test to pass. If this is the intention it should be mentioned
in the readme instructions. Otherwise the student is left wondering if they are
doing something wrong or missed something (like a generate command).
